# Javascript Adventure Game Sandboxes

For my class [HTML](https://github.com/oelna/hsma-html) (which is in fact HTML, CSS and JS) I routinely try to come up with solutions for simple Javascript-based adventure games. Most are simple text adventures or text adventures with static images.

They are really only sandboxes, no actual story or content. But I enjoy working on the problem of how to structure the framework, player objects and screen objects and how to navigate between them.
